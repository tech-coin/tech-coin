THIS .TXT HOLDS MY THOUGHTS ON $TECH AND ALL TECH RELATED THINGS.

- thinking of learning to read 
- the tech of the coin seems to be working, my vibe coded playwright script that launched pump coins through the pump.fun website chrome app was a success.
- who the fuck is claude, every one keeps talking about his app and im wondering if we can get claude to post $TECH
- i should start going by the pseudonym'vibeoshi codeamoto'
- thinking about building a dataset on tech coin holders and selling it to people as alpha wallets so holders have benefits, the data will be in a set and it will be vibe coded 
- people keep saying im cooking, i am not. this is not food. i am vibe coding tech 
-i launched with a github repo to make sure only cultured, upper echelon, socialite, lindy personality type, computer scientific people would purchase the digital coin, so far so good. 
- lots of commits means lots of work, its a fact.
- something: this was added just so people know im doing something, coding the vibes never sleeps 
- make a python script that pushes every single letter written in this .txt file straight away to the repo, one after another, lots of commits = lots of work 
- vibe code the white paper script 
- think of more things to do, look very busy by commiting this word by word 
-run the crop script 
-developing is extremely hard, and you have to be a §HARD§ developer to dev, vibe coders are like the hunters and gatherers at the conception of man (vibe coders will be conceiving a new man(yes, male vibecoders have the power of pregnancy))
- fuck, the banner cropping script has hardcoded outputs, the ai has failed me

python3 banner.py /Users/user/Library/Containers/com.apple.share.System.add-to-iphoto/Data/tmp/img1.jpg

python3 banner.py /Users/user/Library/Containers/com.apple.share.System.add-to-iphoto/Data/tmp/img2.jpg

saving these here to rerun after edits to the script! $TECH go!!
- purchasing a small portion of supply (0.1)through my solana rpc node api i vibe coded (mert sucks i could make helius in a day) and burning it for the 'goys' as they say
- starting thiink about to vibe coding an x account, for the sake of posting and pinning the repo, as a backend dev the idea of using x is extremely overwhelming
